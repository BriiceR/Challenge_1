        Welcome to the Royal Kingdom of Colchis
      </h1>

    <h2>About the Kingdom:</h2>
    <p>
      According to several classical authors, Colchis was a region that was
      surrounded by Pontus, the Black Sea, the Corax River (probably the current
      Bzybi River, in Abkhazia, Georgia), the Greater Caucasus Range ( included
      between Colchis and the Sarmatian Kingdom), Iberia, the Moschici Mountains
      (now the Lesser Caucasus Mountains) and Armenia. However, the southern
      border of Colchis varies according to the classical authors: thus, Strabo
      makes the region begin at Trebizond, while Ptolemy, on the other hand,
      makes the Pontus extend to the river Phase (current Rioni). We know today
      that Pitsounda was the last Colche city located in the north of the
      country.
